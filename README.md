# my-vue-app

> A simple ToDo application written with Vue

## Description

I've created this to learn how to make apps with the Vue framework!

## Goals
This is a small list of things I would like to add or make and integrate into this application:

  1. Make a simple backend app
  2. Host it in the Cloud, either AWS or Google Cloud
  3. Integrate it withing a Jenkins Pipeline
  4. Tests!
  

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
